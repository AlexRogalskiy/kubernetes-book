# Foreword

*“Kubernetes is eating the container world.”*

The hype around Kubernetes continues to grow each day.  It remains a top ten open-source project on GitHub. While the development community has embraced the tool as the de facto standard for container orchestration, decision makers outside the container world have yet to learn about the tangible benefits Kubernetes can provide. 

So why would anyone care about an infrastructure software tool, especially in the context of IoT deployments? 

As it turns out, operational challenges—including deployments, incident management and application management—affect the success of IoT projects just as much as technical challenges regarding devices, networks, etc.. Kubernetes excels in abstracting away cloud infrastructure. It solves key pain points, including service discovery, storage orchestration, self-healing, automated upgrades and rollbacks, configuration management, and horizontal scaling. With Kubernetes managing containers and reducing deployment challenges, our team at Leverege was able to focus more on other technical and operational features rather than trying to keep the existing solution up and running. 

A lot of the documentation and resources online currently are heavily geared toward developers. While this eBook leans toward the technical side, our objective is to illustrate the benefits of Kubernetes and provide enough context to equip your team to with the information you need as you consider implementing Kubernetes. Our eBook is by no means a comprehensive guide on all things Kubernetes but rather a starting point to kick off discussion around using it to deploy in the cloud and/or on the edge. 

At Leverege, we’re committed to amplifying human potential through IoT. We firmly believe that everyone is made better by openly sharing knowledge, so we’ve created this resource for you to use freely. We’ve seen firsthand that many organizations don’t know enough even to begin asking the right questions. We hope to demonstrate the benefits of Kubernetes in the context of IoT. 

If you still have questions after reading this eBook, please don’t hesitate to reach out. IoT may seem hard, but it doesn’t have to be.
